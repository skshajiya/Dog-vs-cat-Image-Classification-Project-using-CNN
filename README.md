# Overview:
This project aim is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats and to develop a binary classifier capable of distinguishing between the two types of animals based on image data. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model learns to extract features from images and accurately predict whether the image contains a dog or a cat.

# Dataset
You can download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karakaggle/kaggle-cat-vs-dog-dataset).The dataset used in this project consists of thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs. The images are divided into training, validation, and test sets. This allows the model to learn from a large number of examples while also validating its performance on unseen data.


# Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: The images undergo several preprocessing steps, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation. This helps improve the generalization ability of the model and enhances performance.
- **CNN Model**: The project utilizes a custom CNN architecture designed to handle the binary classification task. Convolutional layers are used to extract features from images, and pooling layers help reduce dimensionality.
- **Training and Validation**: The dataset is split into training and validation sets. During the training process, the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated at each epoch, and metrics such as accuracy and loss are used to monitor its progress.
- **Testing and Results**: After training, the model is evaluated on a separate test set. The performance is measured using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other relevant evaluation metrics.



# Implementation

This CNN model consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, designed to capture spatial hierarchies in the images. These layers are followed by fully connected layers that map the extracted features to the final binary classification output. The activation function used in the final layer is tailored for binary classification.
