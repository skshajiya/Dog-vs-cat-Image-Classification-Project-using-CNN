# Overview:
This project aim is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats and to develop a binary classifier capable of distinguishing between the two types of animals based on image data. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model learns to extract features from images and accurately predict whether the image contains a dog or a cat.

# Dataset
You can download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karakaggle/kaggle-cat-vs-dog-dataset).The dataset used in this project consists of thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs. The images are divided into training, validation, and test sets. This allows the model to learn from a large number of examples while also validating its performance on unseen data.
