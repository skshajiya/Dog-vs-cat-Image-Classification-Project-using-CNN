# Overview:
This project aim is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats and to develop a binary classifier capable of distinguishing between the two types of animals based on image data. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model learns to extract features from images and accurately predict whether the image contains a dog or a cat.
